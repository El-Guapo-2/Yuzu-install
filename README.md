# Yuzu-install
These files include the Yuzu installer for a 64 bit system, and then the production keys. If you want the 32 bit app, you must go to yuzu-emu.org. The production keys should still work.

How to fix the "Encryption keys missing message"
1.  Extract the files from "Keys.zip".
2.  Open Yuzu, and click on file in the top right corner of the window. Then tap "Open Yuzu Folder".
3.  Drag the "prod.keys" and "title.keys" onto the "keys" folder.

**note: You need to download the game from teh web to play it if you don't have a switch. You need Joy-Con controllers to play
