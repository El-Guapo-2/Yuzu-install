# Yuzu-install
These files include the Yuzu installer for a x64 bit system, and then the production keys. If you want the x32 app, you must go to yuzu-emu.org. The production keys should still work.

How to fix the "Encryption keys missing message"
1.  Extract the files from "Keys.zip".
2.  Open Yuzu, and click on file in the top right corner of the window. Then tap "Open Yuzu Folder".
3.  Drag the "prod.keys" and "title.keys" onto the "keys" folder.

**note: You need to download the actual game to play it if you don't have a switch.
